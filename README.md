# Paper-Reading
This is a repository for the lab members to share the paper collections and summaries.

Current lab Grad students/postdocs: Anjun Ma, Juan Xie, Yuzhou Chang, Junyi Chen, Jing Jiang, Zhaoqian Liu.

On behalf of enhancing the proficiency of Scientific writing as well as the accumulation of up-to-date research achievement, wach lab member should do intensive readings and write summarys, at least one selected paper per week. The summaries will be revised and archived on our BMBL website for further studies.

Specifically, a paper summary should includes aspects listed below:

1. A brief summary of the paper;
2. Significances;
3. A list of unique features/novalties;
4. Well-written sentences/paragraphs and how it/they contribute to our future manuscript writing;
5. For tools, methods, and research articles, a brief workflow or working steps should be described, clearly and explicitly;
6. Any contents, figures, evaluation standards, etc., that can inspire our future work can be highlighted.

You can upload a word file or directly write in txt/markdown on github.
